# taf-verification
This notebook allows the user to verify a NWS issued Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) against observations. All the user needs to provide is the start time of the TAF and the relevant airport. All TAF groups will be plotted including FM groups, TEMPO groups, and PROB30 groups.

Note: The user MUST have a Synoptic API key to use this notebook. Synoptic's API is what is used to obtain observations. Synoptic API keys are available for free for National Weather Service employees.
